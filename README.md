# Trivia-Quiz-Semester-1-Project
For my project, I decided to do a general knowledge type quiz where the program would ask the user questions, and then the user would have a selection of multiple-choice answers for the question. The first thing that I did in the code was set the score to 0, then I made a list of the questions that the program would ask the user and the answers to those questions. After that, I recalled the questions using the list above and printed the actual choices that the user would get. The program then asks for the input of the user which would be in the form of a letter and it would evaluate if the answer chosen is the correct answer. If it is the correct answer then the score increases by one but if it isnâ€™t then the score remains the same. I repeated this for all of the questions and then added a winning condition which was that if the score of the user was equal to or greater then 8 after all the questions were over then they would win but if not then they would lose.
